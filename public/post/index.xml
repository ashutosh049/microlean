      <description>Module: Binary Tree
You can refer to the Leetcode problem 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 Problem Statement Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).</description>

      <description>Module: Binary Tree
You can refer to the Leetcode problem 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Problem Statement Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
 A binary tree&amp;rsquo;s maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
 Example 1:
 (3)/ \(9) (20)/ \(15) (7)Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 3</description>

      <description>corePoolSize vs. maxPoolSize vs. queueCapacity
@Bean @Primary public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() { ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor(); executor.setCorePoolSize(3); executor.setMaxPoolSize(6); executor.setQueueCapacity(4); executor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(false); executor.setThreadNamePrefix(&amp;#34;my-async&amp;#34;); executor.initialize(); return executor; } Core pool size In a nut shell, Core pool size is the happy path. When a new task is submitted and fewer than Core Pool Size threads are running, a new thread is created to handle the request, even if other threads are idle. If there are greater than Core Pool Size but fewer than Max Pool Size threads running, a new thread is created only if no threads are idle.</description>
